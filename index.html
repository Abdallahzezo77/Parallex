    <h2> Eiffel tower</h2>
    <p>
        The Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark and tourist attraction located in Paris, France. It was built by Gustave Eiffel and his team of engineers for the 1889 World's Fair, which was held in Paris to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The tower was initially intended to be a temporary structure, but it proved to be so popular that it was allowed to remain standing.

        The Eiffel Tower is made of wrought iron and stands 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, including its antenna. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world at the time of its completion and held that title for over 40 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930.
        
        The tower has three levels that are open to the public, accessible by elevators or stairs. The first level is 57 meters (187 feet) above the ground and offers views of Paris, while the second level is 115 meters (377 feet) above the ground and provides panoramic views of the city. The third and highest level is 276 meters (906 feet) above the ground and offers stunning views of Paris and the surrounding area.
        
        The Eiffel Tower is illuminated at night and is a popular spot for photographers, as well as for romantic proposals and engagements. It has been featured in numerous films, TV shows, and music videos, and is recognized as one of the most iconic structures in the world.    </p>

        <p> 
            Burj Khalifa is a skyscraper located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is currently the tallest building in the world, standing at a height of 828 meters (2,716 feet) with 163 floors.
